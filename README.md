# Excel-Database
Code to Open and Get data from another file that can be used as an excel database
This code assumes you have a "data" file somewhere in your system where the information is saved.

**First use setup**:
Open the workbook and right click on "View Code" on any sheet
Go to the "data" Module and change the following line to the file path of your database workbook:
**wbFullName = "C:\Users\data.xlsx"**

I can also provide a custom made form to add data to the file, please contact me.
